# ⚡ Power Consumption Analysis using MLOps

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements an **end-to-end MLOps pipeline** for **household power consumption analysis and forecasting**.  
It demonstrates how **machine learning models** can be built, tracked, and automated for **power/energy data** using **DVC** and **MLflow**.

The project focuses on **reproducibility, automation, and experiment tracking**, which are critical in real-world power systems.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Electric power consumption varies over time due to:
- Daily usage patterns
- Seasonal variations
- Load demand changes

The goal of this project is to:
- Analyze historical household power consumption data
- Train a machine learning model to predict power usage
- Automate the entire workflow using MLOps tools
